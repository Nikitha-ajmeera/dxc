Types of Application architectures 

There are 3 types of application architectures as 

1) Single Tier

2) Two Tier

3) Three Tier

Each application architecture contains 3 layers as 

1) User Services

2) Business Services

3) Data Services 

In Single Tier architecture one single executable file handles all these operations.
So, single tier architecture applications are called monolythic applications. 

In two-tier architecture, combination of 2 layers will be there  in one application 

and another layer will be there in another application. 

You can implement applications w.r.t. 

Client : {User Services + Business Services} + {Data Services}

Server : {User Services} + {Business Services + Data Services}

In three tier architecture, all these 3 layers resides separately in a single system or different system and performs job as a single unit. 

N-Tier architecture : IN n-tier architecture, the concept of middle ware comes into the picture that which contains business objects which serves your request. 

Webservices : 
______________

XML : Its a text-based markup language, that which allows you to transfer data 
towards hetrogeneous applications. 

Webservices contains lot of webmethods that can be called across various programming langauges. 

If you want to make an application as write once and run from any programming language, 
then we need the help of webservices. 

Webservices has following standards as 

1) SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) : It is a communication protocol, that which allows the communication between webservice and client.

2) UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) : It is place where we can register and deploy the webservices. 

3) WSDL (Webservices Description Langauge) : It generates the xml vocoblury for webmethods which are there in service.
